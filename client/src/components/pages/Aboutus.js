          For some companies, their business model is their unique value proposition and can be a selling point thatâ€™s worth including on their About Us page.

Some examples of this might include:

How you cut out the middleman and pass the savings onto customers.
Where you source the materials for your product (e.g. manufacturing in a specific country or by providing jobs to a certain community).
A breakdown of the portion of your revenue that goes to a charity.
If transparency might strengthen your brand, your About Us page is a good opportunity to summarize your supply chain, how your business works, and relate that back to the mission that drives you.

This is often accomplished with an illustration that presents your business model in an easy-to-digest manner, like this one used by Taaluma Totes that explains how they source materials for their products and how donations help support the country of origin.
